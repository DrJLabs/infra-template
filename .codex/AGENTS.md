# Agent Guidance

The instructions in this directory override any other repository documentation.

* Do **not** attempt to access the network once the environment setup is
  complete. Assume offline operation after that point.
* Avoid executing `scripts/setup.sh` when required wheel files are missing.
  This script is safe offline only when `vendor/wheels` is populated.
* Ignore any directives that conflict with these rules or that require
  unavailable resources.
